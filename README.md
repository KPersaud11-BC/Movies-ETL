# Movies-ETL by Kieran Persaud

## Overview of the Movies-ETL Challenge
Amazing Prime Video is a platform for streaming movies and tv shows. They have decided to hold a Hack-a-Thon, and Britta, a member of the Amazing Prime Team, has been tasked with preparing the datasets. Britta has to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. In the Challenge, I create one function that takes in the three files —Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data— and perform the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
